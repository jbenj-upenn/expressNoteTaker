# Note-Taking App
## Express

You can access the app here: https://expressnotetaker-jbenj.herokuapp.com/

# Description
This is an application that allows users to write, save, and delete notes. It utilizes an express backend and saves and recalls note data from a JSON file.

If you need help keeping track of important to-dos, brilliant ideas, or appointments, just click "Get Started" and find the clean GUI, which allows you to title your note and add the details of it. Don't forget to click that "Save" icon in the upper-right hand corner of the page. 

# Future Implementation
Future implementations will include 
-further refinement of functionality, especially adding an "Enter" button function that allows the user's note to be saved that way, rather than having to click on the "save" icon
-display properties, including color changes and bringing the "save" and "write note" icons closer to the input areas. 

# Built With

HTML
CSS-Bootstrap
JavaScript
jQuery - Javascript libraries.
Nodejs: Express, FS, Nodemon
